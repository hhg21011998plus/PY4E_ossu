# Exercise 1: Change the socket program socket1.py to prompt the user for the URL so it can read any web page.
# You can use split('/') to break the URL into its component parts so you can extract the host name for the socket connect call.
# Add error checking using try and except to handle the condition where the user enters an improperly formatted or non-existent URL.


# Exercise 2: Change your socket program so that it counts the number of characters it has received
# and stops displaying any text after it has shown 3000 characters. The program should retrieve the entire document
# and count the total number of characters
# and display the count of the number of characters at the end of the document.

# Exercise 3: Use urllib to replicate the previous exercise of (1) retrieving the document from a URL,
# (2) displaying up to 3000 characters, and (3) counting the overall number of characters in the document.
# Donâ€™t worry about the headers for this exercise, simply show the first 3000 characters of the document contents.
